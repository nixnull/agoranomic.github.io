      <h2>Welcome to Agora!</h2>
      <p>
        Agora is a <a href="http://www.nomic.net">nomic</a>, a game in
        which the rules can be changed as part of the gameplay itself.
        The concept of Nomic, and an initial ruleset, was invented
        by <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/hometoc.htm">Peter
          Suber</a>, and published in
        <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm">an
          appendix to his book <em>The Paradox of
            Self-Amendment</em></a> in 1982; Agora started with a very
        similar ruleset (adapted for play via email) on 30 June
        1993, and since then has become one of the world's
        longest-lasting nomics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over its history of over 22 years, Agora has seen over 7800
        proposals, and over 1300 rules enacted; but rules are amended
        frequently and repealed at much the same rate they are
        enacted, meaning that
        <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/rkeep/current_flr.txt">the ruleset</a>
        is often fresh and interesting for new and experienced players
        alike, rather than continuously accreting rules until the game
        becomes unplayable.  Although the game has been won on over 60
        occasions, it can continue on after a win, giving everyone a
        chance to succeed (not that winning is easy; most months,
        nobody accomplishes it).  The course of the game is charted by
        its over 3500
        <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/">judicial
          cases</a>, via which disputes are resolved.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Agora?</h2>
      <p>
        Agora is a relatively serious nomic; many of its players see
        it as an experiment in philosophy, political science, and
        group dynamics, rather than just a game; sometimes it acts
        more like a country.  It tends to be relatively conservative
        as nomics go, in that major rules changes often take a while
        to happen and are commonly debated in advance.  Unlike some
        other nomics, much of Agora's gameplay is concerned with the
        proposals system and the rules themselves, with many wins
        having been via exploiting loopholes in even long-standing
        rules, just as other players prefer to win in the "intended"
        fashion.  However, it is not uncommon for substantial subgames
        to be proposed, played for a while, and then repealed when
        players bore with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Agorans tend not to be above silliness and
        having fun; some players will do things just to see what will
        happen, or to create unusual situations merely to observe the
        resulting chaos.  Agora occasionally experiments with
        mechanics designed only to shake things up a bit (such as
        randomized rule changes, or offices whose only job is to try
        to repeal rules); and once 
        went
          to war over an insult that Agorans were "a generally
        boring lot".

      <h2>Thinking of playing?</h2>
      <p>
        As of May 2017, there are three mailing lists (see following lists for details) most players subscribe to:
        <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-business">agora-business</a>
          (<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-business@agoranomic.org/info.html">public
            archives</a>) is the main forum used for the vast majority
          of game actions, such as voting on proposals and new players
          registering;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-official">agora-official</a>
          (<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-official@agoranomic.org/info.html">public
          archives</a>) is used for official reports mandated by the
          rules, like proposal distributions and reports of the rules
          and list of players, and is a good place to check on the
          current state of the game;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-discussion">agora-discussion</a>
          (<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-discussion@agoranomic.org/info.html">public
          archives</a>) is the officially supported mailing list for
          discussion about the game and things that go on there,
          although it cannot be used for game actions (posting them to
          agora-discussion by mistake is quite common!).
        </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          There are also two backup lists,
          <a href="http://www.listserver.tue.nl/mailman/listinfo/agora">tue</a>
          and
          <a href="http://yoyo.its.monash.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/nomic">yoyo</a>,
          are used to continue the game if the main mailing lists are
          down for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more informal discussion, there is also an official IRC
        channel, <a href="irc:irc.freenode.net/##nomic">##nomic on
          freenode.net</a>
        (<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23nomic">web
          access</a>), where several players of Agora (and other nomics)
        tend to gather.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although many players prefer to watch for a while rather than
        playing (with Agora having attracted quite a sizeable list of
        "Watchers", who sometimes join in discussion about the game
        despite not playing), it's entirely possible to jump right in
        and start playing.  Before joining, you should probably read
        the rules; the most recent rulesets can normally be found in
        the agora-official archives, or
        <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/rkeep/current_flr.txt">online</a>.
        Probably, you can join by simply sending a message to
        agora-business stating that you register, although as always
        in nomic, the rules are subject to change.
